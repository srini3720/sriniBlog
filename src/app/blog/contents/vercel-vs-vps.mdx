In the dynamic landscape of web development, selecting the optimal hosting solution is crucial for achieving operational excellence. Recently, our team at safrow decided to transition from Vercel to a Virtual Private Server (VPS). This strategic move was driven by the desire for greater flexibility, control, and cost-effectiveness.

This blog post delves into the reasons behind our decision, the seamless deployment process on Hetzner, and the performance outcomes that exceeded our expectations.

## Strategic Advantages of VPS

The switch from Vercel, a robust platform known for its Next.js support, to a VPS was motivated by several key considerations:

1. **Enhanced Control:** VPS provides us with increased control over our server configurations, enabling custom setups tailored to our specific needs.

2. **Cost-Efficiency:** For larger projects, VPS can offer more cost-effective solutions, particularly for resource-intensive applications that require tailored scaling.

3. **Skill Development:** Managing a VPS environment enhances our team's skills in server administration and deployment, fostering professional growth.

3. **Tailored Performance:** With the ability to fine-tune server settings, we optimized our applications for peak performance.
